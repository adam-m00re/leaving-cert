		<h2>Climate Change</h2>
		<p>The Climate Emergency we currently face requires adequate and immediate action. It is one of the most pervasive and threatening crises of our time.  If we continue along our current path, scientists say that the consequences will be devastating, having implications on where we live, how we grow food and other services vital to our well-being. A 2°C increase could mean more heat waves, a ten-fold increase in Arctic ice-free summers and a complete wipe-out of the world's coral reefs, home to millions of species.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The global warming that’s changing our climate is already having dire consequences. In just the past few decades we have found that there have been:
		<h5>&nbsp;</h5>

		<ul>
			<li>  Rising global temperatures limiting ski seasons</li>
			<li>Rising temperatures have worsened extreme weather events</li>
			<li>Chunks of ice in the Antarctic have broken apart.</li>
			<li> Wildfire seasons are months longer.</li>
			<li>Coral reefs have been bleached of their colors.</li>
			<li>Mosquitoes are expanding their territory, able to spread disease</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<h2></h2>
		<p2>With rising global temperatures threatening to limit the skiing season and even warm some resorts out of existence, major ski companies are turning to their customers for help in the fight against climate change. Their goal: turn millions of snow-lovers into climate voters.</p2>
		
		<h3></h3>
		<p3>Winter sports companies are now trying to mobilize those millions of skiers, snowboarders and other winter enthusiasts into a passionate political force for action on climate change by encouraging them to contact policy makers, vote for climate-friendly candidates and spread the word about climate change in their circles.  The winter sports industry knows it is facing an uncertain future.</p3>
		
		<h4></h4>
		<p4>One study found that climate change will shorten the winter recreation season across the U.S., with half as many downhill skiing days in some places by 2050 and up to 80 percent fewer by 2090.</p4>
